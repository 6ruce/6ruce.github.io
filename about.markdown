Pulling ideas and learnings out of your head and writing them down is the best way to understand their core concepts. This personal blog is an attempt at this exercise. Hello, my name is Vitalii; I'm a software engineer at Grammarly. If you want to share or discuss some cool FP staff with me, please send a message on any socials you can find in the [CONTACT](/contacts.html) section.
